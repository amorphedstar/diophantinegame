      <p>
        Diophantine games involve an integer equation in some number of
        variables. Two players take turns choosing values for the variables,
        with one player trying to make the equation true in the end, and the
        other trying to make it unsatisfiable. J. P. Jones, motivated by the
        theory of Diophantine equations, studied Diophantine games and
        <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01769063">
          constructed a game in which one player has a winning strategy which is
          not computable
        </a>
        . The equation specifying this game is shown above as an excerpt from
        his paper.
